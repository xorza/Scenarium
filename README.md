# Scenarium

Scenarium is a collection of tools and libraries for building node based data processing pipelines.
The core graph and utilities are written in Rust.

## Repository Layout

- **common** – shared utilities used across the workspace
- **graph** – the main graph library
- **deprecated_code** – older editors and experimental code
- **test_resources** – sample assets used by tests

## Maintenance

Workspace dependencies are kept at their latest minor versions (patch versions left open).
Common utilities receive periodic safety and ergonomics updates.
