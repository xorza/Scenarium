# Scenarium

Scenarium is a collection of tools and libraries for building node based data processing pipelines.
The core graph and utilities are written in Rust.

## Repository Layout

- **common** – shared utilities used across the workspace
- **graph** – the main graph library
- **editor** – visual editor for building executing graphs
- **test_resources** – sample graphs and media used by tests

Implementation details and recent editor behavior changes are documented in `NOTES-AI.md`.
