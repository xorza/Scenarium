Refer to bench-analysis.md for SIMD optimization status and benchmark data.

When running benchmarks:
- Save raw output to bench-results.txt
- Update bench-analysis.md with analyzed results
- Run only the specific benchmarks needed for the current optimization

The bench-analysis.md documents which conversions benefit from SIMD and which are memory-bound (no SIMD benefit).
