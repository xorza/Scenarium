TileGrid::new_with_mask Benchmark Results (6144x6144 globular cluster)
======================================================================

After optimization (sampling + word-level mask ops + 2 sigma iterations):

bench_tile_grid_6k_globular (no mask):
  45.03ms (min: 18.12ms, max: 71.47ms, median: 45.09ms, 10 iters)
  vs previous: 130.72ms -> 45.03ms (-65.6% faster)

bench_tile_grid_6k_with_mask (6.8% masked):
  31.75ms (min: 27.20ms, max: 62.75ms, median: 28.22ms, 50 iters)
  vs previous: 69.00ms -> 31.75ms (-54.0% faster)

Optimizations applied:
1. Sampling for large tiles (~1024 samples max per tile)
2. Word-level mask operations using trailing_zeros() for sparse masks
3. Reduced sigma clipping iterations from 3 to 2
4. Subsampling when too many unmasked pixels collected
