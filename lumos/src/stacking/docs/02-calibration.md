# Stage 2 — Calibration: Best Practices & Algorithms

## Scope & Goal

Calibration is the second stage of the astrophotography pipeline (after decode/ingest,
before star detection / registration / stacking). Its job is to convert a *raw sensor
readout* — which carries the instrument's additive and multiplicative signatures on top
of the sky signal — into a *linear estimate of the light that actually fell on each
pixel*, with sensor artifacts removed. Concretely it must:

1. Remove **additive** instrument signal: bias/offset (read-out pedestal + fixed-pattern
   read noise) and dark current (thermally generated electrons + amp glow).
2. Remove **multiplicative** instrument signal: the flat field (vignetting, optical
   throughput variation, dust-mote shadows, pixel-to-pixel quantum-efficiency variation).
3. Repair **deterministic defects**: hot/cold/dead pixels and bad columns that no
   amount of averaging can fix because they carry no real signal.
4. Optionally reject **transient outliers** (cosmic rays / satellite/airplane streaks)
   that survive into a single frame.

The non-negotiable invariant across all of this is **linearity**: every operation must
keep pixel value proportional to incident photons (plus a known constant), because every
*later* stage — flux-weighted centroids, noise-weighted stacking, photometry, drizzle —
assumes a linear scale. Calibration that subtracts the wrong constant, divides by a
mis-normalized flat, or clamps negative pixels to zero quietly destroys that invariant
and biases everything downstream.

This document separates **best practice** (what the authoritative implementations do and
agree on) from **anti-patterns** (documented failure modes). Source code is cited by path
into the cloned reference repos under `.tmp/refs/`; online claims are cited by URL and
cross-checked against at least two independent sources.

## 1. The calibration equation

### 1.1 The canonical form

Every reference reduces to the same per-pixel equation. With `L` the raw light frame,
`B` master bias, `D` master dark, `F` master flat, `FD` flat-dark (a dark taken at the
flat's exposure), and `m` a scalar normalization of the flat:

```
                 L − D                              L − (B + k·Dc)
calibrated  =  ───────── · m       (full form:  ─────────────────── · m)
                 F − FD                              (F − FD)
```

The DeepSkyStacker theory page states it as
`Light = (RawLight − Offset − DarkFactor·(Dark − Offset)) / (Flat − Offset)`
where `Offset` is the bias, `Dark − Offset` is the bias-free dark current, and
`DarkFactor` is the dark-scaling coefficient (see §2.4). ccdproc's `ccd_process`
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/ccdproc/ccdproc/core.py:138`) applies
the identical sequence as discrete steps: overscan → trim → gain → bias → dark → flat
(lines 294–375). Siril's `preprocess()`
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/siril/src/core/preprocess.c:124`)
does bias-subtract → dark-subtract → flat-divide in that exact order (lines 127–156).

The decomposition into bias `B` and scaled dark current `k·Dc` only matters when you
*scale* the dark (§2.4). When the dark is used 1:1 (matched exposure/temperature/gain),
the dark already contains the bias, and you subtract `D` in a single step — subtracting
bias *and* an unscaled `D` would remove the bias twice. ccdproc's flat-calibration guide
makes this explicit: *"If the combined dark frame needs to be scaled to a different
exposure time, then bias and dark must be handled separately; otherwise, the dark and
bias can be removed in a single step because dark frames also include bias."*
(https://www.astropy.org/ccd-reduction-and-photometry-guide/v/dev/notebooks/05-03-Calibrating-the-flats.html)

**Verified against the Astropy guide's own forward model** (pass 2, parsed from the
calibration-overview notebook). The guide writes the *raw* readout as

```
raw image = bias + noise + dark_current + flat·(sky + stars)
```

and solves it for the science signal:

```
stars + noise = (raw_image − bias − dark_current)/flat − sky
```

This is identical in form to the lumos equation above (sky-subtraction is a later,
post-calibration step). The single most important line in that notebook is *"It is
impossible to remove the noise from the raw image because the noise is random"* — the
`+ noise` term never cancels; calibration removes the *deterministic* structure (bias,
dark, flat) and leaves a noise floor that the **stacking** stage then beats down by √N.
This framing is why §2 obsesses over making the masters quiet: a master is the only place
where you can drive the calibration term's *own* noise toward zero before it is mixed in.

### 1.2 Why this order

The order is forced by the *physics of how the signals combine*. The sensor readout is

```
L = (sky·QE·throughput·vignette  +  dark_current·t  +  bias)   [+ shot/read noise]
```

Bias and dark are **additive** and must be removed by **subtraction**; the flat is
**multiplicative** and must be removed by **division**. You cannot divide before
subtracting, because the additive pedestal is *not* scaled by the flat — dividing first
would spread the bias/dark pedestal through the (non-flat) flat field and imprint
vignetting onto what should be a constant offset. Subtract the additive terms first to
get a clean `sky·(multiplicative)`, *then* divide out the multiplicative term. This is
the "additive-before-multiplicative" rule and every reference enforces it
(opticalmechanics, celestron, astropy guide — three independent sources agree).

The same logic applies *inside* the flat: the flat frame itself contains bias + (small)
dark current, which are additive and must be removed from `F` **before** `F` is used as a
divisor — hence `F − FD` (or `F − B`). If you divide lights by a flat that still has its
own pedestal in it, you inject the flat's bias signal into your data
(opticalmechanics; astropy guide). Lumos therefore subtracts `flat_dark` (or `bias` as
fallback) while preparing the normalized flat once in `CalibrationMasters::from_images`.

### 1.3 Linearity and the pedestal problem

After dark subtraction, background pixels straddle zero: dark-frame shot noise means a
sky-free pixel is `0 ± σ`, so roughly half its noise excursions are **negative**. These
negative values are *real information*. Clamping them to zero biases the mean upward and
corrupts later noise-weighted statistics. lumos handles this correctly: `CfaImage::subtract`
deliberately keeps negatives — *"Clamping to zero would introduce a positive bias in the
stacked result"* (`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/src/astro_image/cfa.rs:144`, in
`subtract` at line 146).

The classic workaround in integer pipelines (MaxIm DL, some CCD software) is a **pedestal**:
add a fixed constant (commonly 100 ADU) after subtraction so values stay non-negative,
and account for it at every later step
(verified: grokipedia "Dark-frame subtraction"; AAVSO DSLR photometry guide). A float
pipeline like lumos (`f32`, normalized `[0,1]`) needs no pedestal because it represents
negatives natively — the better solution. The pedestal is only an integer-storage hack.

### 1.4 Noise & error propagation through calibration (Newberry 1991)

Every arithmetic step in calibration *adds* the calibration frame's noise to the data,
and because the random fluctuations are uncorrelated they **add in quadrature**. The
canonical derivation is Newberry 1991, *Signal-to-noise considerations for sky-subtracted
CCD data* (PASP 103, 122; parsed pass 2). Work in **electrons** throughout (multiply ADU
by gain `g`), because counting statistics are Poisson in electrons, not ADU.

**The base-level (per-pixel, signal-independent) noise** is the sum in quadrature of three
fixed terms (Newberry eq. defining `B²`):

```
B² = R² + T² + F²        [electrons²]
```

- `R` — **read noise** (intrinsic to the readout electronics; present in *every* frame,
  including bias). Astropy: read noise "is impossible to eliminate."
- `T` — **truncation/digitization noise**, `T² = (g²−1)/12` electrons² (the variance of a
  uniform distribution over one ADU). Negligible at low gain; Newberry's worked example
  has `g = 10 e⁻/ADU` → `T² = 99/12 ≈ 8 e⁻²` vs `R² = 400 e⁻²`. A float pipeline that never
  re-quantizes to integers carries `T ≈ 0` after the first read.
- `F` — **processing noise**: everything the *calibration frames* inject. This is the term
  calibration controls.

**Per-pixel shot terms** add on top of `B²` for an exposed pixel: object shot noise
`σ²_obj = C_obj` and sky shot noise `σ²_sky = C_sky` (Poisson: variance = count). The
total noise in a single calibrated science pixel is therefore approximately

```
σ²_pix ≈ C_obj + C_sky + dark_current·t + R² + F²        [electrons²]
```

with `F²` the accumulated calibration noise derived below. The take-away: **the flat and
dark only matter through `F`; make `F` small and the pixel returns to its photon+read-noise
limit.**

**Stage-by-stage propagation** (Newberry eqs. 16–21; each operation combines independent
noises in quadrature):

| Operation | S/N transform | Consequence |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Subtract a bias/dark frame (eq. 18) | `(S/N) → (S/N)₁·[1 + (σ₂/σ₁)²]^(−1/2)` | subtracting an *equally-noisy* single frame **doubles the variance** (√2 worse). |
| Combine N frames (eq. 17) | variance ÷ N | averaging N subs cuts the master's variance by N (noise by √N). |
| Divide by a flat (eq. 19) | `(S/N) → (S/N)₁·[1 + ((S/N)₁/(S/N)_FF)²]^(−1/2)` | the flat's *relative* error adds in quadrature; harmless only if `(S/N)_FF ≫ (S/N)₁`. |
| Multiply/divide by a noiseless constant (eq. 21) | `(S/N)` unchanged | pure normalization (e.g. dividing the flat by its mean) costs no S/N. |

**Why many darks/bias matter — the √2 / √N argument.** Newberry's eq. 18 shows that
subtracting a master that has the *same* per-pixel noise as the light **doubles** the
base-level variance (the new readout-equivalent noise is `√2·R`). To make the master's
contribution negligible you must average enough subs that the master variance `R²/N` is
small versus the light's own `R²` — i.e. `N` large. Newberry's worked example (20 e⁻ read
noise, `g = 10`) shows the data reduction adds ≈20–50 e⁻ of *processing* noise per pixel
across bias+dark+flat — *"we have effectively increased the readout noise by these
amounts."* The Astropy guide states the same conclusion non-mathematically: *"If one tried
to calibrate images by taking a single bias image and a single dark image, the final result
might well look worse than before the image is reduced."* This is the quantitative basis for
the "50–100 bias, 20–50 dark" rules of thumb in §2.1.

**Why the flat is the dangerous divisor.** Newberry's eq. 19 makes the flat's cost depend on
the data's *own* S/N: for a bright pixel (`(S/N)₁` large) even a 0.5%-uncertain flat
(`(S/N)_FF ≈ 200`) injects significant noise, while for a faint sky-limited pixel the same
flat is harmless. In Newberry's example the **flat-field division is the single largest S/N
degradation for the high-count case** precisely because its 50 000 e⁻ carry shot noise that
is divided into the data without adding any signal. Practical corollary: a flat must be both
*well-exposed* (high `(S/N)_FF` per sub) **and** built from many subs — a dim or few-sub flat
is the easiest way to ruin an otherwise high-S/N image.

**Gain / electrons treatment.** All of the above is in electrons. ccdproc bakes this in:
`ccd_process` builds an **uncertainty (deviation) frame** via `create_deviation(gain,
readnoise)` immediately after trim and *before* gain/bias/dark/flat
(`.tmp/refs/ccdproc/ccdproc/core.py:318`), so every subsequent operation propagates a
Poisson+read-noise error array alongside the data. `cosmicray_lacosmic` likewise *"always
need[s] to work in electrons"* and takes `gain`/`readnoise` explicitly (core.py:1541+). lumos
does not carry a per-pixel uncertainty frame; it instead uses a normalized-domain
**NoiseModel{electrons_per_normalized_unit, read_noise_electrons}** in star detection and
**noise weighting** at the stack — equivalent in spirit
(variance ∝ `1/σ²`) but it cannot propagate the flat's pixel-by-pixel error the way an
explicit uncertainty array does. *Opportunity (see §7): an optional uncertainty plane.*

---

## 2. Master frame creation

A master frame exists to make calibration **noise-free relative to the lights**. If your
master adds its own noise, you are trading one noise source for another. The widely cited
rule of thumb: with too few subs you can *triple* the post-calibration noise versus the
uncalibrated light, requiring ~9× more lights to recover — so masters must be built from
enough subs that their noise is negligible
(opticalmechanics "Mastering Calibration Frames"; corroborated by practicalastrophotography).

### 2.1 How many subs, and which combine method

Consensus across sources (opticalmechanics, celestron, practicalastrophotography,
chaoticnebula):

| Frame   | Typical count | Combine method                         | Notes |
|---------|---------------|----------------------------------------|-------|
| Bias    | 50–100 (100+) | average + outlier rejection, or median | cheap (0 s); take many |
| Dark    | 20–50         | average + sigma/winsorized clip, or median | must NOT clip amp-glow region as outlier |
| Flat    | 20–50 per filter | average + sigma clip after per-frame normalization | normalize each sub before combining |
| Flat-dark | 20–50       | same as dark                           | matched to flat exposure |

Sigma-clip threshold for *combining calibration subs* is typically **κ ≈ 3.0** high
(starfieldview "Sigma Clipping"; opticalmechanics). **Winsorized** sigma clipping (replace
outliers with the clip boundary rather than discarding) is recommended because it rejects
outliers without throwing away the pixel's statistical weight — useful for the modest sub
counts typical of calibration. DSS additionally offers median, kappa-sigma, auto-adaptive
weighted average, and entropy-weighted average
(http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/technical.htm via search).

**Why average-with-rejection beats plain median for masters:** the median of N frames has
~1.57× (π/2) the variance of the mean for Gaussian noise — equivalently ~1.25× the *standard
deviation* (√(π/2) ≈ 1.25; this is the asymptotic median variance (π/2)·σ²/N, derived in full
below) — so a sigma-clipped/winsorized *mean* keeps more SNR while still rejecting cosmic rays
and the occasional satellite. Median is the
robust fallback when N is too small for rejection statistics to be reliable. lumos encodes
exactly this heuristic: `stack_cfa_frames` uses the frame-type preset (winsorized mean for
darks/bias at σ=3.0, sigma-clip mean for flats at σ=2.5) when N ≥ 8, and falls back to
median below 8 frames
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/src/calibration_masters/mod.rs:92`;
presets at `/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/src/stacking/config.rs:163`).

ccdproc's `Combiner` exposes the same toolbox: `average_combine`, `median_combine`,
`sum_combine`, plus `sigma_clipping`, `minmax_clipping`, and `clip_extrema` masking, and
supports per-frame `weights`
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/ccdproc/ccdproc/combiner.py:298–740`).

**Combine-method choice by frame type — the rationale.** The choice is driven by *what kind
of outlier* each frame type must reject and *how many subs* are typically available:

- **Bias / dark** — no transient sky signal, so the only outliers are CRs and occasional RTS
  flicker. With the 50–100+ subs you can cheaply take, **winsorized or sigma-clipped mean**
  maximizes S/N (it keeps the √N advantage of the mean while rejecting the rare hit). lumos
  uses winsorized κ=3 (`stacking/config.rs:163,171`); PixInsight recommends Winsorized sigma
  clipping with a permissive ~3σ for large bias/dark sets (verified via search, pass 2).
- **Flat** — must reject *moving* contaminants (a passing satellite, a stray hot pixel that
  drifts if the panel shifts) **and** equalize the per-frame illumination level, so flats are
  **per-frame normalized first, then sigma-clip-mean combined** (lumos κ=2.5 +
  `Normalization::Multiplicative`, `config.rs:185`). Normalizing *before* combining is what
  lets clipping see real outliers rather than illumination drift.
- **Light** — sigma/winsorized clip at the stack is the CR/plane/satellite remover (§4.1);
  lumos adds **noise weighting** so quieter subs count more (`config.rs:191`).

The deeper reason mean-with-rejection beats median is variance: for Gaussian noise the
sample **median has π/2 ≈ 1.57× the variance of the mean** (often quoted as the ~1.25×
*standard-deviation* ratio, √1.57 ≈ 1.25). A sigma-clipped/winsorized mean recovers almost
all of that lost S/N while still being robust; median is the fallback only when N is too
small for clip statistics to be trustworthy — which is exactly lumos's `< 8 frames → median`
switch (`calibration_masters/mod.rs:92`).

### 2.2 Bias vs superbias

A **master bias** is the average of many zero-(or minimum-)exposure frames; it captures the
read-out pedestal and the fixed-pattern read noise. Because bias subs are free to take,
take 100+ — the master bias should be far quieter than anything it calibrates. A
**"superbias"** (PixInsight term) is a *modeled/smoothed* master bias: the master bias is
decomposed (e.g. multiscale/wavelet) and the random component discarded, keeping only the
deterministic fixed pattern. This yields an essentially noise-free bias model. lumos has no
superbias modeling — its bias master is a straight winsorized mean (a reasonable v1).

**How SuperBias actually works** (PixInsight, verified pass 2). The module *"simulates the
result of stacking thousands of individual bias frames"* by running a **multiscale
decomposition** (default **7 layers**) over an ordinary master bias whose dominant signal is
*"a pattern of vertical and/or horizontal stripes."* It then reconstructs **only the
structured (large-scale) component and discards the small-scale detail layers** that carry the
random noise: the output has *"absolutely no random noise"* (Blackwater Skies, verbatim) yet
retains the fixed pattern. The layer count works in the *opposite* sense to first intuition:
because the small-scale layers are the ones thrown away, **fewer layers preserve more (finer)
structure** while **more layers discard progressively coarser detail**, smoothing harder and so
attenuating large-scale banding. Default is **7**; reduce to ~6 when the master bias already
came from ≥50 subs (so finer real structure survives), and *raise* it (Blackwater Skies found
10 layers "reduces the effect of the large scale horizontal band pattern" along the top edge)
when a broad band must be suppressed. The precondition: SuperBias only helps when
the bias's fixed-pattern noise is *structured* (amplifier banding). For a featureless,
well-randomized bias it gains little — and on CMOS where the bias itself is unreliable (next
subsection) the concept is moot because you skip the bias entirely.

### 2.3 When each frame type is actually needed

- **Bias**: needed if (a) you scale darks (§2.4) — then bias must be removed separately, or
  (b) you calibrate flats with bias instead of flat-darks, or (c) you synthesize a master
  dark for a different exposure. **Caveat:** many modern CMOS sensors (e.g. ASI294,
  IMX571/455 families) *cannot produce a reliable bias frame* — their shortest exposures are
  non-linear / the bias drifts, so a "bias" frame makes calibration *worse*
  (britastro CMOS bias thread; astroworldcreations Part 3; cloudynights). For these, **skip
  bias entirely** and keep the bias signal inside matched darks and flat-darks.
- **Dark**: removes dark current and (critically) **amp glow**. Needed for any exposure long
  enough that thermal signal or amp glow is significant. Must match the lights' **exposure,
  gain/ISO, and temperature** (sensor temperature for CMOS, ideally set-point cooled).
- **Flat**: removes vignetting, dust shadows, and pixel-QE variation. Needed essentially
  always for deep-sky; it is the frame that most visibly improves images (flat field is what
  makes a gradient-free, dust-free background possible).
- **Flat-dark** (a.k.a. dark-flat): a dark matched to the **flat's** exposure time. The
  modern best practice for CMOS — subtract a flat-dark from the flat instead of a bias,
  because the flat-dark captures the (non-linear, drifting) short-exposure pedestal that a
  bias frame cannot. Switching bias→flat-dark is the documented fix for **residual rings**
  after flat correction on CMOS with unstable bias
  (astroworldcreations Part 3; cloudynights; mypetstars). lumos models this directly:
  `flat_darks` is its own role and takes **priority over bias** when normalizing the flat
  (`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/src/calibration_masters/mod.rs:181`).

### 2.4 Dark scaling / dark optimization — and when it fails

**Dark scaling** multiplies the bias-subtracted master dark by a factor `k` before
subtraction, to compensate when the dark's exposure or temperature does not exactly match
the light. Two ways to compute `k`:

1. **Exposure ratio** (the linear, physically-motivated factor): `k = t_light / t_dark`.
   Siril's `darkOptimization` uses this when `use_exposure` is set (and warns if the dark is
   *shorter* than the lights)
   (`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/siril/src/core/preprocess.c:178–198`).
   ccdproc's `subtract_dark(scale=True)` computes
   `scale_factor = data_exposure / dark_exposure` and multiplies the master before
   subtracting
   (`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/ccdproc/ccdproc/core.py:843–856`).

2. **Noise/entropy minimization** (the empirical "dark optimization"): search `k` to
   minimize the noise (or entropy) of the *calibrated* background. Siril does a
   **golden-section search** (golden ratio `GR = (√5−1)/2`) over `k ∈ [0, 2]` to tolerance
   `0.001`, evaluating, for each trial `k`, the **mean background σ over a 512×512 central
   square** of the dark-subtracted image (`evaluateNoiseOfCalibratedImage`, summed across
   channels as `Σ σ/normValue`) and minimizing it
   (`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/siril/src/core/preprocess.c:44–122,161–198`,
   verified pass 2). The central-square restriction keeps amp-glow corners and vignetted edges
   from biasing the noise estimate. DeepSkyStacker searches `k ∈ [0, 5]` in 0.01 steps
   minimizing either Shannon **entropy** (`ComputeMinimumEntropyFactor`) or RMS
   (`ComputeMinimumRMSFactor`), **per color channel** for OSC (`fRedFactor`/`fGreenFactor`/
   `fBlueFactor`)
   (`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/DeepSkyStacker/DeepSkyStackerKernel/DarkFrame.cpp:127–265, 574–791`).
   Notably DSS treats amp glow *separately* from the dark factor: `CDarkAmpGlowParameters`
   models the glow gradient (hottest-minus-coldest region medians, `DarkFrame.cpp:1051+`)
   rather than folding it into the single multiplicative `k` — an implicit admission that one
   scalar `k` cannot fit both dark current and glow.

**Mandatory precondition:** dark scaling is only valid on the **bias-free** dark
(`Dark − Offset`). The bias pedestal does *not* scale with exposure; scaling a dark that
still contains bias multiplies the pedestal by `k` and leaves a residual offset. This is why
the ccdproc *guide* insists bias and dark be handled separately whenever the dark is scaled,
and why DSS works on `Dark − Offset`. Note the precondition is a *workflow* rule, not enforced
by the code: `subtract_dark(scale=True)` simply computes `scale_factor =
data_exposure/dark_exposure` and multiplies whatever master it is handed before subtracting
(core.py:851, verified pass 2); keeping that master bias-free is the caller's responsibility,
which `ccd_process` arranges by subtracting the master bias (core.py:346) *before* the scaled
dark (core.py:355).

**When dark scaling fails (anti-pattern territory):**
- **Scaling *up* a short dark amplifies its noise** (a failure mode independent of amp glow).
  The Astropy guide is explicit: *"Do not take short dark frames and scale them up to longer
  exposure times … If you rescale those images to a longer exposure time then you
  inappropriately amplify that noise"* (parsed pass 2). Multiplying a dark by `k > 1` scales
  its read+shot noise by `k` too, so a `k = 10` scale-up injects 10× the dark's noise — worse
  than no dark. Scaling *down* (`k < 1`) is safer but still imperfect. Siril guards exactly
  this: it **warns when `k = t_L/t_D > 1`** (master dark shorter than the lights, preprocess.c:191).
- **Amp glow does not scale with the dark-current pedestal.** Subtlety worth stating
  precisely: amp glow *does* grow roughly linearly with **exposure time at fixed gain and
  temperature** (Astropy LFC example: sensor glow *"grows linearly with exposure time"*), but
  it does **not** track the thermal dark-current pedestal when **temperature or gain** change,
  and its spatial profile is fixed by the readout electronics, not by integration. So a single
  multiplicative `k` chosen to match the dark-current level cannot simultaneously match the
  glow, leaving a residual glow gradient. *"amp glow does not behave linearly so it's always
  important to not use dark scaling if your sensor has significant amp glow"* (telescope.live;
  cloudynights; astropixelprocessor — three sources). The cure is *matched* darks (same
  exposure/gain/temperature) so the glow subtracts 1:1, never scaling.
- **CMOS pattern/telegraph noise** doesn't scale cleanly either (cloudynights IMX455/571).
- **Over-correction** from scaling produces dark mottle/holes where the scaled dark exceeded
  the light's true dark signal (cloudynights "Darks over-correcting").

**Bias-dependence and temperature.** Two preconditions underlie all scaling: (1) the
dark-current rate must itself be *stable* — the Astropy guide recommends a **hot-pixel
stability test**: shoot darks at several exposures; *"If the dark current is constant then
the dark counts will be properly removed … If the dark current is not constant, the pixel
should be excluded"* (parsed pass 2). Unstable (RTS) hot pixels cannot be scaled and belong
in the defect map (§3). (2) Dark current roughly **doubles every ~5–7 °C**, so even a small
temperature mismatch breaks the `k = t_L/t_D` linearity that assumes only exposure differs —
which is why CMOS guidance insists on *set-point cooled* temperature matching, not scaling.

**Best practice:** match darks to lights in exposure/gain/temperature and use `k = 1` (no
scaling). Reserve scaling for well-behaved, glow-free CCDs where exact matching is
impractical. **Disable dark optimization when the sensor has amp glow** (universal advice).
lumos currently does **not** scale darks at all (always `k = 1`), which is the safe default
but means it cannot reuse a dark library across exposures — see §7.

### 2.5 Flat illumination & normalization

**Illumination requirements.** A flat must be (a) **uniform** — sky flats (twilight), an EL
panel, or a T-shirt over the OTA — and (b) exposed into the sensor's **linear regime**:
roughly 1/3–1/2 of full well (ADU ~20k–35k for a 16-bit sensor), never near saturation and
never so dim that read noise dominates. PixInsight notes that with *"sufficiently exposed
flat frames, no clipping will arise, so the application of an output pedestal is never needed
in the calibration of flat frames"*
(https://www.pixinsight.com/tutorials/master-frames/ via search). Each flat must use the
**same optical train, focus, and camera rotation** as the lights (dust shadows move
otherwise), and a fresh flat set is required per filter.

**Illumination source trade-offs** (sky vs dome vs panel). All three aim for the same thing —
a *spatially flat, spectrally representative* illumination filling the same light cone as the
sky — but trade differently:

| Source | Uniformity | Spectrum match | Gotchas |
|--------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Twilight/sky flats** | excellent (sky is intrinsically smooth) | best for broadband (true sky-like SED) | narrow time window; sky gradient + stars require dither-and-median across many subs; level changes fast → variable exposures, hence per-frame normalization |
| **Dome / wall (white screen)** | good if evenly lit | depends on lamp color temperature | uneven dome lighting imprints a false large-scale gradient; reflections |
| **EL/LED panel** | very good (Lambertian emitter) | LED SED is *not* white → strong per-channel level imbalance on OSC | drives the per-CFA-channel color-shift problem (below); cheap and repeatable |

The panel's spectral mismatch is exactly why per-channel flat normalization (below) became
standard: a "white" LED panel is typically blue-heavy and green-rich, so R/G/B land at very
different ADU even though the *vignetting/dust pattern* — the only thing a flat must capture —
is identical across channels.

**Why divide, not subtract.** The flat encodes a **multiplicative** response: each pixel's
recorded value is `true_flux · s(x,y)` where `s` is the local sensitivity (QE · transmission ·
vignette · dust-shadow factor), `s ∈ (0, 1]`. Vignetting that darkens a corner to 60 % means
`s = 0.6` there; the *fix* is `value / 0.6 = value · 1.667`, i.e. **division**, which is
flux-conserving and restores the corner to its true level. Subtracting a flat would instead
remove a *constant* — wrong dimensionally (you'd be subtracting a sensitivity from a flux) and
it would leave the multiplicative gradient intact while corrupting the zero point. A dust
shadow at `s = 0.7` is similarly *restored* by `÷0.7`, not by adding back a fixed ADU. The
additive terms (bias, dark) were already removed first (§1.2) precisely so that what remains is
a clean `true_flux · s` that division cleanly inverts.

**Normalization — divide by the mean.** Before a flat can be a divisor it is normalized to
unity mean (or median): `F_norm = (F − FD) / mean(F − FD)`. ccdproc's `flat_correct`
normalizes the (optionally min-clipped) flat by its mean (or a supplied `norm_value`) and
then divides
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/ccdproc/ccdproc/core.py:927–1013`).
Siril computes the normalization as the **mean of a central region** of the flat
(`startx = width/3 … `, to avoid the vignetted edges biasing the mean) and divides by it via
`siril_fdiv`
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/siril/src/core/preprocess.c:332–366`).
Dividing by the mean keeps the calibrated light at the same overall flux scale (the flat
only *reshapes*, it does not rescale brightness). ccdproc also exposes `min_value` to floor
the flat and prevent division by near-zero in deeply vignetted corners (core.py:970–975) —
lumos guards the same case by only dividing where `norm_flat > f32::EPSILON`
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/src/astro_image/cfa.rs:232,243`).

**Per-channel normalization for OSC / CFA flats — the color-shift fix.** A flat taken with a
non-white source (LED panel, twilight) has *different mean levels in R, G, and B*. If you
normalize an OSC flat by a single global mean, division rescales the channels unequally and
**shifts the color** of every calibrated light.

*Derivation of the failure.* Let the per-color sensitivity be `s_c(x,y)` and the panel emit
color-dependent flux `P_c`, so a flat pixel of color `c` reads `F_c = P_c · s_c`. The *only*
thing a flat should remove is the **shape** `s_c(x,y)/⟨s_c⟩` (vignette + dust); the per-color
*level* `P_c·⟨s_c⟩` is an illumination artifact that must cancel. Normalizing the *whole*
mosaic by one global mean `m = ⟨F⟩` gives a divisor `F_c/m`, and dividing a light `L_c` by it
yields `L_c · m / (P_c·s_c)`. The residual factor `m/P_c` differs per channel → a fixed
**color cast** baked into every light. Normalizing **each color by its own mean** `m_c =
⟨F_c⟩` instead gives divisor `F_c/m_c = s_c/⟨s_c⟩` — the pure shape, with `P_c` cancelled — so
the light comes out as `L_c·⟨s_c⟩/s_c`, no per-channel rescale. That is the fix, and it is now
standard:
- **PixInsight** added *"Separate CFA flat scaling factors"* in ImageCalibration 1.8.8-6,
  computing 3 CFA scaling factors so *"the color shift that occurred with flat field
  correction in previous versions is avoided"*
  (Landmann ImageCalibration guide; pixinsight.com — verified).
- **Siril** `compute_grey_flat` computes per-color channel means over the CFA pattern via
  Welford's online mean/variance, **infers the Bayer pattern as the candidate with minimum
  green-channel variance** (a robustness trick — the correct pattern makes the two green
  sub-lattices most self-consistent), then applies `coeff1 = R̄/Ḡ`, `coeff2 = B̄/Ḡ` to equalize
  R and B *to green* before division
  (`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/siril/src/core/siril.c:453–514`,
  re-verified pass 2), gated by the `equalize_cfa` option (`preprocess.c:329`).
- **DeepSkyStacker** computes per-channel (R/G/B) dark factors and flat handling.
- **lumos** does this natively: `calibration_masters::prepared_flat` accumulates
  independent R/G/B sums once, normalizes each color by its own mean, and stores the
  resulting divisor for every light.

Note the subtle policy difference: lumos/PixInsight normalize each channel to its **own**
mean (color balance deferred to a later white-balance/PCC step), whereas Siril's
`compute_grey_flat` equalizes the channels **relative to green** (preserving the flat's
green-referenced balance). Both avoid the global-mean color shift; they differ only in
which neutral point they pick.

### 2.6 Overscan / bias drift

True CCDs have a physical **overscan** region (non-illuminated readout columns) used to track
the bias level *per frame*, absorbing slow bias drift between exposures. ccdproc supports
this with `subtract_overscan` (median or modeled per row/column) and `trim_image`
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/ccdproc/ccdproc/core.py:487` and
`ccd_process` lines 294–315). Consumer CMOS/DSLR sensors expose no overscan; the bias-drift
problem there is handled either by frequent bias re-takes or — better — by folding bias into
matched darks/flat-darks (§2.3). lumos has no overscan support (irrelevant for its RAW/CMOS
target audience, but a gap for scientific CCD data).

---

## 3. Defect / hot-pixel maps

Hot, cold, and dead pixels and bad columns are **deterministic** sensor defects: they read a
wrong value regardless of incident light, so averaging cannot fix them and they must be
*detected* and *replaced*. The master dark is the natural detector (hot pixels are obvious in
a dark), though a defect map can also be built from a master flat (dead pixels) or supplied
externally.

### 3.1 Detection: broad dark subtraction + robust residual thresholds

Lumos first separates sensor-scale dark structure from point defects:

1. Compute a robust median for each CFA color in balanced 64×64 tiles.
2. Bilinearly interpolate those medians, including linear extrapolation from the outer tile
   centers to the sensor edges, to obtain a smooth per-color dark-current model.
3. Subtract the model. Sensor gradients and amp glow therefore remain calibration signal rather
   than being misclassified as point defects.
4. Compute the **median** and **MAD** of each color's residual population:
   `MAD = median(|rᵢ − median(r)|)`.
5. Convert to a robust sigma: `σ ≈ 1.4826 · MAD` (the constant is `1/Φ⁻¹(0.75)`; for a
   normal distribution MAD ≈ 0.6745·σ).
6. Flag **hot** if `r > median(r) + k·σ`.

**Why MAD, not standard deviation:** std is itself inflated by the very outliers you are
hunting (a few 60000-ADU hot pixels balloon σ and hide the merely-warm ones). MAD has a 50%
breakdown point — up to half the pixels can be outliers and the median/MAD stay valid. lumos
documents this rationale in `stacking/calibration_masters/defect_map.rs`.

**Why a tiled model instead of a same-color neighbor median:** a compact hot cluster can dominate
the immediate neighborhood of every member, making the cluster its own reference. A 64×64 tile
has enough red/blue samples for a robust median while remaining small relative to broad sensor
gradients. The interpolated model follows amp glow, but isolated points, hot columns, and compact
same-color clusters remain positive residuals.

**Correction (pass 2):** the prior pass stated Siril's `find_deviant_pixels` uses
*"mean ± k·σ"*. The source actually computes thresholds as **`median ± k·σ`** —
`median = stat->median`, `sigma = stat->sigma` (ordinary STATS_BASIC stddev), then
`thresHot = median + sig[1]·sigma`, `thresCold = max(median − sig[0]·sigma, 0)`
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/siril/src/filters/cosmetic_correction.c:200–213`,
re-verified pass 2). So Siril and lumos agree on the **median** as the central statistic; they
differ only in the **σ estimator** — Siril uses the ordinary (outlier-inflated) standard
deviation, lumos uses the robust MAD-derived σ. lumos's MAD estimator is therefore the more
robust choice, but the central-statistic difference asserted in pass 1 was wrong.

**Correction (pass 2):** the DSS *"median + 16·σ"* figure was flagged in pass 1 as
search-snippet-sourced. It is now **primary-verified** in the DSS source: hot-pixel detection
computes, *per RGB channel*, `threshold = histogram.GetMedian() + 16.0 · histogram.GetStdDeviation()`
and flags any pixel above its channel threshold
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/DeepSkyStacker/DeepSkyStackerKernel/DarkFrame.cpp:1738–1745`).
The `16.0` is hardcoded — a deliberately loose multiplier so only genuine hot pixels are
caught. Net: the *threshold statistic* varies by implementation (lumos median+MAD·σ at k=5,
Siril median+stddev·σ, DSS median+16·stddev), all per-color; lumos's MAD-based estimator is
the most robust; the σ-multiplier is a tuning knob, not a correctness issue.

**Per-CFA-color modeling and statistics.** On raw CFA data, the green pixels (50% of a Bayer frame) sit at
a different baseline than red/blue. Computing one global median/MAD lets green dominate and
masks defects in red/blue. Lumos fits the dark model and computes residual thresholds
**per color**, so a hot red pixel is tested only against red residuals. The synthetic regression
combines unequal color baselines, unequal gradients, unequal amp-glow strength, isolated R/G/B
points, and a 25-member same-color cluster; the detected list is exactly the injected list.

**Sigma-floor guard.** A pristine, near-uniform dark has MAD ≈ 0, which would make *any*
slightly-warm pixel exceed `k·σ` and flag 3%+ of the sensor. lumos floors σ with
`σ = max(1.4826·MAD, 5e-4)` — the absolute floor (`5e-4` ≈ 33 ADU in 16-bit space)
prevents flagging the noise tail of clean CMOS darks. The former `median·0.1` floor was removed
because it hid warm pixels at 1.1–1.4× a positive dark baseline.

**Adaptive sampling.** Exact median over a 60-megapixel channel is slow; lumos subsamples to
at most 100K residuals per color. This is sound for detection thresholds: the model is evaluated
for every pixel during classification, while only the robust distribution estimate is sampled.

### 3.2 Correction: same-CFA-color neighbor median

A defect is replaced by a **robust local estimate**, never by zero or by a raw neighbor of the
wrong color:

- **Mono:** median of the 8-connected neighbors (lumos `median_of_neighbors_raw`,
  `defect_map.rs:253–285`).
- **Bayer:** median of **same-color** neighbors at **stride 2** (the nearest pixels behind the
  *same* color filter). Replacing a hot red pixel with adjacent green/blue values would inject
  a false color into the demosaic. lumos `bayer_same_color_median` uses the 8 stride-2
  neighbors (`defect_map.rs:307–334`); Siril's cosmetic median uses `step = 2` for CFA data,
  same idea (`cosmetic_correction.c:46, 73–74, 131–132`).
- **X-Trans:** lumos searches a ±6-pixel window (13×13 = 169 candidates; since the X-Trans
  mosaic repeats every 6 px this spans roughly two full periods in each direction) for
  same-color pixels, sorts by Manhattan distance, and medians the closest 24 to avoid
  directional bias (`defect_map.rs:340–383`). (The in-code comments are loose about this —
  `defect_map.rs:290` says "2*period", `:337` says "one full period"; the literal value is
  `radius = 6`.) (Siril explicitly refuses cosmetic correction on X-Trans —
  `preprocess.c:388–390` — so lumos is *more* capable here.)

Using the **median** (not mean) of neighbors is important: a defect often clusters with other
defects or sits next to a star, and the median resists those.

### 3.3 The defect taxonomy: hot, cold, RTS, bad columns

Not all defects are alike, and the distinction matters for whether a *static* defect map can
fix them at all:

- **Hot pixels** — elevated, *stable* dark current. The bread-and-butter of a defect map:
  they read the same high value in every dark, so `median + k·σ` on the master dark catches
  them and a neighbor median repairs them. Stable across frames → a static map suffices.
- **Cold / dead pixels** — stuck low or zero (a dead photosite or a broken readout). Often
  *invisible in a dark* (a dead pixel reads ~0, indistinguishable from the dark floor) — these
  are better found in a **flat**, where an unresponsive pixel shows as a dark spot under
  uniform illumination. lumos first subtracts bias or flat-dark from the master flat, then
  detects cold/dead pixels on that unfloored response via a local same-color-neighbor ratio
  (`< DEAD_PIXEL_FRACTION × local median`). The local reference tracks vignetting and dust
  shadows where a global `median − k·σ` cut cannot (`defect_map.rs`, `detect_cold`).
- **RTS / "flickering" / telegraph pixels** — random-telegraph-signal pixels that hop between
  two or more levels *between frames*. They are the trap for static maps: a single master dark
  catches them only if they happened to be "high" during that capture, and a fixed map then
  mis-corrects the frames where they were "low." The Astropy hot-pixel **stability test**
  (§2.4) is exactly how you flag them — *"If the dark current is not constant, the pixel should
  be excluded"* — and once excluded, the *correct* tool is **dither + stack rejection** (§3.4),
  not the defect map.

**Bad columns** are a special
case neither lumos nor Siril's dark-map path handles directly: a full bad column has no good
same-color *horizontal* neighbors nearby, so a per-pixel neighbor median degrades (it pulls
from the adjacent bad column). DSS specifically offers *"detect and remove hot pixels **and
bad columns**"* as a stacking option (DSS technical docs via search), and the robust general
remedy is **dithering** (§3.4) + outlier rejection at the stack: shifting the column across
the sky between frames turns a fixed bad column into a rejectable per-frame outlier.
**Gap:** lumos has no explicit bad-column model.

### 3.4 Dithering as a complement to defect maps

Defect maps fix *known, static* defects. **Dithering** — nudging the mount a few pixels
between exposures — is the complementary technique for everything else: residual hot pixels,
walking noise, fixed-pattern noise, and bad columns become *non-coincident* across frames in
sky coordinates, so the stacking rejection (sigma/winsorized clip) removes them and they
average down (opticalmechanics; multiple guides). The practical doctrine: **dither + robust
stack first, defect map as cleanup** — the defect map then only has to handle the few pixels
too consistently bad to reject. Calibration and acquisition strategy are coupled here.

---

## 4. Cosmic ray rejection

Cosmic rays (and satellite/airplane streaks) are sharp, localized, single-frame events. Two
families of methods:

### 4.1 Multi-frame rejection (sigma clipping at the stack)

When you have many registered lights, **per-pixel sigma/winsorized clipping during stacking**
removes any value far from the stack median — cosmic rays included. This is the cheapest and
most reliable CR removal *when you have enough frames* and is what lumos relies on (its light
preset uses σ=2.5 sigma-clip,
`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/src/stacking/config.rs:191`). Caveats: it needs
enough frames for robust statistics, and stacks with very different PSF widths force a
lenient-vs-strict tradeoff (cambridge.org PASA "Evaluation of CR rejection"; swarp clipped-mean paper).

### 4.2 Single-frame rejection: L.A.Cosmic (van Dokkum 2001)

**L.A.Cosmic** identifies cosmic rays in a *single* image by **Laplacian edge detection**: a
CR has *sharper edges* than a (PSF-broadened) star, so a Laplacian highlights it independently
of its shape or size. The key insight is that sharpness, not contrast, separates CRs from real
sources — so the method works even when a CR is larger than a median-filter kernel or the PSF
is undersampled. The full algorithm, parsed from the paper (van Dokkum 2001, PASP; arXiv
astro-ph/0108003, `.tmp/papers/lacosmic_vandokkum2001.txt`), per iteration is:

1. **Subsample ×2.** Block-replicate the image to `2n×2n` (`I⁽²⁾`). Done so the Laplacian's
   negative cross-pattern around bright pixels doesn't attenuate adjacent CR pixels; results
   are independent of the factor and ×2 is cheapest (paper eq. 5).
2. **Convolve with the Laplacian kernel** `∇²f = [[0,−1,0],[−1,4,−1],[0,−1,0]]` (eq. 4),
   giving `L⁽²⁾`. CR edges are positive inside, negative outside.
3. **Clip negatives** to zero: `L⁽²⁾⁺ = max(L⁽²⁾, 0)` (eq. 7) — retains CR flux, removes the
   cross-pattern.
4. **Resample back ×2** (block-average) to `L⁺` at native resolution (eq. 8).
5. **Build the noise model** `N = (1/g)·√(g·(M₅∘I) + σ_rn²)` where `g` = gain (e⁻/ADU),
   `σ_rn` = read noise (e⁻), `M₅` = 5×5 median filter (eq. 10). The median-filtered image gives
   a CR-free estimate of the expected Poisson level per pixel.
6. **Significance image** `S = L⁺ / (f_s·N)` (eq. 11, `f_s` = subsampling factor). This is the
   Laplacian in units of *σ above expected Poisson noise*.
7. **Remove sampling flux** so bright smooth structure doesn't trip the threshold:
   `S′ = S − (S∘M₅)` (eq. 12) — a 5×5 median removes structure smooth on ≳5 px while leaving
   CRs and noise untouched.
8. **Build the fine-structure image** `F = (M₃∘I) − ((M₃∘I)∘M₇)` (eq. 14). `F` is large for
   *symmetric* point sources (stars retain flux) but **near-zero for CRs** (asymmetric).
9. **Flag** a pixel as a CR iff **`S′ > σ_lim`** AND **`L⁺/F > f_lim`**. `σ_lim` (≈`sigclip`)
   is the Laplacian-to-noise limit; `f_lim` (≈`objlim`) is the minimum CR-to-fine-structure
   contrast. Defaults: `f_lim = 2` for well-sampled data, `≈5` for undersampled (HST WFPC2).
   The paper's worked numbers: a critically-sampled star has `L⁺/F = 0.7`, an undersampled
   star `1.8`, but a CR `21` — easily separated.
10. **Grow + replace + iterate.** Optionally lower the threshold for pixels *neighboring*
    flagged CRs (the `sigfrac` mechanism), replace flagged pixels with the median of
    surrounding good pixels, and repeat — large CRs need several passes because the Laplacian
    only retains ~50% of an interior CR pixel's flux per iteration (paper eq. 13).

Reported reliability (van Dokkum's WFPC2 test): found **98.1% of >6σ** and **99.1% of >10σ**
CR-affected pixels, with only **1.2% false positives at ≥6σ and 0.02% at ≥10σ** — better than
neural-net morphological classifiers.

ccdproc wraps the astroscrappy port as `cosmicray_lacosmic` with canonical defaults — verified
in source pass 2 — `sigclip=4.5, sigfrac=0.3, objlim=5.0, gain=1.0, readnoise=6.5, niter=4`
(`/Users/xxorza/Projects/Scenarium/lumos/.tmp/refs/ccdproc/ccdproc/core.py:1541+`), where:
- **`sigclip`** = `σ_lim`, the Laplacian-to-noise limit (lower → more sensitive);
- **`sigfrac`** = the *neighbor* threshold is `sigfrac·sigclip` (step 10 above), so 0.3 means
  pixels touching a CR are flagged at `0.3·4.5 = 1.35σ`;
- **`objlim`** = `f_lim`, the minimum `L⁺/F` contrast (raise to protect bright stellar cores);
- **`niter`** = iteration count.
It *"always need[s] to work in electrons"* — hence the explicit `gain`/`readnoise` — i.e. it
must run on **linear, calibrated** data. ccdproc also offers a simpler `cosmicray_median`
(subtract an 11×11 median, threshold at `k·σ`, optionally grow and replace) (`core.py:1949`).

### 4.3 Where CR rejection belongs in the pipeline

The important, well-sourced nuance: **single-frame CR rejection (L.A.Cosmic) belongs before
registration/warping**. Van Dokkum 2001 motivates single-frame rejection precisely for this
case — it is desirable *"if the images are shifted with respect to each other by a non-integer
number of pixels"* (arXiv astro-ph/0108003, verified) — because a non-integer shift forces the
warp to *interpolate*, and a CR smeared by a Lanczos kernel becomes a low-amplitude blob that
sigma clipping can no longer reject. (The "interpolation spreads unrejected CRs" framing is the
standard operational rationale behind this ordering; it is *not* a verbatim van Dokkum quote —
the paper states it through the non-integer-shift argument above.) So:

- **Few frames / single frame** → run L.A.Cosmic on each *calibrated, pre-registration* frame.
- **Many frames** → dither + sigma/winsorized clip at the stack catches most CRs, but running
  L.A.Cosmic first still protects against interpolation smearing of the brightest hits.

L.A.Cosmic is itself **not** part of master-frame creation (you reject CRs in the *masters*
via the same combine-time clipping). It is a *light-frame* operation, logically after
calibration (it needs linear data + gain/read-noise) and before warp. **Gap:** lumos has no
single-frame CR rejection; it relies entirely on stack-time clipping.

**L.A.Cosmic vs median-stack rejection — when to use which.** They are complementary, not
redundant, and the boundary is *frame count and dither*:

| | Median / sigma-clip at the stack | L.A.Cosmic (single frame) |
|---|---|---|
| Needs | many frames (≳5–8 for robust stats) | works on **one** frame |
| Discriminates CR from star by | a CR hits one frame, a star is in all | edge *sharpness* + fine-structure symmetry |
| Fails when | a CR lands on the same sky pixel in ≥half the frames; few frames; CRs smeared by warp interpolation | very crowded fields with severely undersampled stars (needs higher `objlim`) |
| Cost | free (already in the stack) | a per-frame convolution pass |

The decision rule: **with many dithered frames, the stack rejection is the workhorse** and is
all lumos has. **With few frames, a single frame, or before any interpolating warp**, run
L.A.Cosmic first — because the paper itself motivates single-frame rejection precisely for the
cases where stacking fails: *"pixels can be hit by cosmic-rays in more than one exposure, and
some affected pixels may remain after combining individual images,"* and *"images … shifted by
a non-integer number of pixels."* Running L.A.Cosmic *before* warp turns the brightest hits
into flagged/replaced pixels so the subsequent Lanczos resampling can't smear them into
un-rejectable low-amplitude blobs.

## 5. Recommended best-practice implementation

An opinionated, concrete target for a CFA-aware float pipeline like lumos.

### 5.1 Process raw CFA *before* demosaic

Do **all** calibration on the un-demosaiced single-channel CFA frame, then demosaic. Two hard
reasons: (1) defect correction must use **same-color** neighbors, which is only well-defined
on the mosaic — demosaicing first smears a hot pixel across a 2–3 px color neighborhood and
makes correct repair impossible; (2) dark/bias/flat are sensor-domain quantities that pair
1:1 with mosaic pixels. Siril (`debayer` is the *last* step in `prepro_image_hook`,
`preprocess.c:440`) and lumos (`calibrate` operates on `CfaImage`, README + `mod.rs:165`)
both do this. **Anti-pattern:** demosaic → calibrate (§6).

### 5.2 Canonical order (per light frame)

```
1. (optional) overscan-subtract + trim          [CCD only]
2. additive removal:
      if matched dark:        L −= D            (D contains bias)
      elif scaled dark:       L −= B; L −= k·(D − B)   (k = t_L/t_D; CCD, glow-free only)
      elif bias only:         L −= B
3. multiplicative removal:    L /= normalize(F − FD_or_B)   [per-CFA-channel mean]
4. defect correction:         replace hot/cold via same-color neighbor median
5. (optional) L.A.Cosmic on the calibrated frame, if few subs / before warp
   → then hand off to registration & stacking
```

lumos's `calibrate` implements steps 2–4 exactly (`mod.rs:171–189`). Note: do defect
correction **after** flat division (Siril order, `preprocess.c`) so the neighbor medians are
computed on fully-calibrated values; lumos matches this.

### 5.3 Master-frame parameters

- **Bias:** 100+ subs, winsorized mean κ=3, no normalization. Consider a smoothed
  superbias model. *Skip entirely on CMOS with unreliable short exposures.*
- **Dark:** 20–50 subs matched in exposure/gain/temp, winsorized mean κ=3, **no scaling by
  default**; expose scaling only as an opt-in for glow-free CCDs, and force separate bias when
  scaling.
- **Flat:** 20–50 per filter, exposed into the linear regime (~1/3–1/2 well, roughly
  20k–35k ADU on a 16-bit sensor — never saturated, never read-noise-dominated), sigma-clip
  mean κ≈2.5 *after per-frame normalization*; central-region mean for the normalization
  constant; **per-CFA-channel** scaling for OSC; floor the flat (`min_value`) to avoid
  div-by-near-zero. Both axes matter: Newberry eq. 19 shows the flat must have *high per-sub
  S/N* (well-exposed) **and** *many subs* — either alone is insufficient for high-S/N lights.
- **Flat-dark:** prefer over bias for flat calibration on CMOS.

### 5.4 Numerical care

- Keep everything in **f32 (or accumulate in f64)** and **preserve negatives** through
  subtraction; never clamp to 0. lumos accumulates flat means in f64
  (`cfa.rs:207–217, 263–289`) — correct.
- Guard flat division: skip/floor pixels where the normalized flat ≤ ε (lumos: `> f32::EPSILON`).
- Per-color means must use **exact pixel counts** per CFA color (lumos asserts `counts[c] > 0`).
- Defect σ via **MAD** with a **floor** to avoid over-detection on clean darks.

### 5.5 CFA-aware defect correction

Stride-2 same-color median for Bayer; full-period same-color search for X-Trans; 8-neighbor
median for mono. (lumos already does all three.)

---

## 6. Pitfalls & anti-patterns

1. **Wrong operation order — dividing before subtracting.** Imprints vignetting onto the
   additive pedestal. Always additive (subtract) before multiplicative (divide). (§1.2)
2. **Scaling a dark that still contains bias.** `k·(D)` scales the bias pedestal too,
   leaving a residual offset. Scale only `D − B`, and handle bias separately when scaling
   (ccdproc forces this). (§2.4)
3. **Dark scaling / dark optimization on amp-glow sensors.** Amp glow is non-linear; a single
   `k` can't match both glow and dark current → residual glow gradient or over-correction.
   *Disable dark optimization when amp glow is present* (three independent sources). (§2.4)
4. **White-balancing / globally normalizing OSC flats.** A single global mean on a non-white
   flat rescales R/G/B unequally → permanent **color shift** in every calibrated light. Use
   per-CFA-channel scaling. (§2.5)
5. **Clamping negative pixels to zero after dark subtraction.** Half of a sky-free pixel's
   noise is legitimately negative; clamping injects a **positive bias** and corrupts
   noise-weighted stacking. Preserve negatives (use float / a pedestal). (§1.3)
6. **Demosaicing before calibrating.** Destroys the 1:1 sensor mapping and makes same-color
   defect repair impossible; smears hot pixels. Calibrate on the raw CFA, demosaic last. (§5.1)
7. **Darks not matched in temperature / exposure / gain.** Mismatched darks leave dark-current
   residuals or, worse, over-subtract → dark mottle. Match all three (CMOS temperature is the
   sensor set-point). (§2.3)
8. **Using bias to calibrate flats on CMOS with unstable bias.** Causes residual rings; switch
   to **flat-darks**. (§2.3)
9. **Too few calibration subs.** A noisy master *adds* noise — can triple post-calibration
   noise. Use the recommended counts. (§2)
10. **Flats clipped/saturated or too dim.** Saturated flat pixels are non-linear (bad
    divisor); too-dim flats are read-noise-dominated. Aim ~1/2 well. (§2.5)
11. **Dividing by an un-floored flat.** Deeply vignetted corners → near-zero divisor →
    exploding values / NaN. Floor the flat (`min_value`) or skip ε-small pixels. (§2.5)
12. **Replacing a defect with a wrong-color or zero value.** Injects false color / dark holes.
    Use same-CFA-color neighbor median. (§3.2)
13. **Standard deviation instead of MAD for defect thresholds.** σ is inflated by the very
    outliers you're hunting; use MAD (50% breakdown). (§3.1)
14. **Rejecting cosmic rays only after warping.** Interpolation smears CRs across pixels,
    defeating sigma clipping; run single-frame CR rejection *before* registration. (§4.3)
15. **Treating defect maps as a substitute for dithering** (or vice-versa). They're
    complementary — dither + robust stack handles transients & bad columns; the defect map
    handles persistent hot/cold pixels. (§3.4)
16. **Scaling a *short* dark *up* to a longer exposure.** `k > 1` multiplies the dark's own
    read+shot noise by `k`, injecting more noise than it removes — *"you inappropriately
    amplify that noise"* (Astropy). Take darks at least as long as the lights; Siril warns when
    `k = t_L/t_D > 1`. (§2.4)
17. **Putting RTS/flickering pixels in a static defect map.** A pixel that hops between levels
    between frames is "high" in only some of them; a fixed correction mis-repairs the rest.
    Detect via the multi-exposure stability test, exclude, and let dither + stack rejection
    handle them. (§2.4, §3.3)
18. **A dim or few-sub flat on high-S/N data.** Newberry eq. 19: flat-field division is the
    *dominant* S/N degradation for bright pixels, scaling with `(S/N)_data/(S/N)_flat`. A dim
    or few-sub flat (low `(S/N)_flat`) ruins an otherwise high-S/N image even though it "looks
    fine." Well-expose the flat *and* take many subs. (§1.4, §2.5)
19. **Running L.A.Cosmic on un-calibrated / non-linear data.** It builds a Poisson+read-noise
    model and *"always need[s] to work in electrons"* — run it on linear, calibrated frames
    with correct gain/read-noise, never on gamma-encoded or pedestal-shifted data. (§4.2)

## 7. How lumos currently does it — and gaps/opportunities

**What lumos gets right (matches authoritative practice):**

- **Order is correct:** dark (or bias) subtract → flat divide → defect correct, all on raw
  CFA before demosaic (`calibration_masters/mod.rs:171–189`). Matches Siril/ccdproc.
- **Flat-dark over bias** for flat calibration — the modern CMOS best practice
  (`mod.rs:181`).
- **Per-CFA-channel flat normalization** — avoids OSC color shift; aligns with PixInsight
  1.8.8-6 "separate CFA flat scaling factors" and Siril's `compute_grey_flat`
  (`astro_image/cfa.rs:253–289`).
- **Preserves negative pixels** through subtraction (`cfa.rs:142`) — correct for linearity.
- **Robust MAD-based, per-color defect thresholds with a sigma floor and adaptive sampling**
  (`defect_map.rs`) — same median center as Siril but with a **MAD σ** (vs Siril's ordinary
  σ, vs DSS's `median+16·σ`), so more robust to the outliers being hunted; more capable than
  Siril on X-Trans.
- **Same-CFA-color neighbor median** correction for Bayer/X-Trans/mono — mathematically correct,
  and repaired from a **defect mask** so clustered defects draw only on good (non-defect) neighbors.
- **Cold/dead pixels from the bias/flat-dark-subtracted, unfloored master-flat response** via a local same-color-neighbor ratio
  (`< DEAD_PIXEL_FRACTION × local median`, `defect_map.rs` `detect_cold`) — catches the dead pixels
  that read normal in a dark, and tracks vignetting where a global `median − k·σ` cut cannot.
- **Sensible combine presets:** winsorized-mean darks/bias (κ=3), sigma-clip flats (κ=2.5),
  with median fallback below 8 frames (`stacking/config.rs:163–197`; `mod.rs:92`).

**Gaps and opportunities (in rough priority):**

1. **No dark scaling / optimization.** Always `k = 1`. Safe (avoids the amp-glow failure
   mode), but cannot reuse a dark library across exposures. *Opportunity:* add an opt-in
   exposure-ratio scaling (`k = t_L/t_D`) that **requires** separate bias subtraction (like
   ccdproc `scale=True`), explicitly gated off when amp glow is detected; optionally a Siril-
   style noise-minimizing or DSS-style entropy-minimizing search for glow-free CCDs.
2. **No single-frame cosmic-ray rejection.** Relies entirely on stack-time sigma clipping —
   fine for many dithered frames, weak for short sequences and vulnerable to warp-smearing.
   *Opportunity:* an L.A.Cosmic pass on calibrated frames before registration (needs
   normalized signal-to-electron conversion and read noise, which lumos models in `NoiseModel`).
3. **No bad-column handling.** Per-pixel neighbor median degrades on full columns. *Opportunity:*
   detect persistent columns from the master dark and repair from cross-column same-color
   neighbors, or document reliance on dither + clip.
4. **No superbias / no bias modeling, no overscan.** Bias is a plain winsorized mean; no
   overscan support for scientific CCDs. Lower priority for the RAW/CMOS target.
5. **No hot-pixel stability (RTS) test.** Hot pixels are flagged from a single master dark, so a
   random-telegraph pixel that happened to read low during that capture is missed (and a fixed map
   mis-corrects the frames where it later reads high). *Opportunity:* Astropy-style per-pixel
   stability test across the dark sub-stack (§2.4, §3.3) to exclude RTS pixels from the static map
   and leave them to dither + stack rejection. (Cold/dead-from-flat detection — previously listed
   here — is now implemented; see "what lumos gets right" above.)
6. **No defect-map persistence / external bad-pixel-map import** (Siril supports
   `apply_cosme_to_image` from a file, `preprocess.c:437`). *Opportunity:* serialize the
   `DefectMap` so it can be reused / hand-edited.
7. **Flat normalization uses the whole-frame mean**, not Siril's central-region mean. For
   heavily vignetted optics the edge pixels pull the mean down slightly; a central-region (or
   median) normalization would be marginally more robust. Minor.
8. **No per-pixel uncertainty plane.** ccdproc carries a Poisson+read-noise error array
   through every step (`create_deviation`, core.py:318) so the flat's pixel-by-pixel error
   propagates into the final variance (Newberry §1.4). lumos approximates this with a scalar
   normalized-domain `NoiseModel` + noise-weighted stacking, which captures *frame-level* but
   not *pixel-level* flat/dark noise. *Opportunity:* an optional uncertainty `Buffer2<f32>` per
   channel, propagated through subtract/divide, would make noise-weighted stacking and SNR
   estimates rigorous. Lower priority but the principled endpoint.

### Notes on source disagreements / unverifiable items

- **Defect threshold statistic differs by tool (corrected pass 2):** lumos uses **median+MAD·σ**
  (robust, k=5); **Siril uses median + ordinary-σ** (cosmetic_correction.c:200–213 — pass 1
  said "mean", which was **wrong**); DSS uses **median + 16·ordinary-σ** per RGB channel
  (DarkFrame.cpp:1738, now primary-verified). All three center on the **median**; they differ
  only in the σ estimator (MAD vs ordinary stddev) and multiplier. The σ-multiplier is a
  tuning knob, not a correctness issue; lumos's MAD σ is the most robust.
- **OSC flat neutral point differs:** lumos/PixInsight normalize each channel to its own mean;
  Siril equalizes R/B to green (pattern inferred by minimum green variance). Both avoid the
  global-mean color shift.
- **DSS hot-pixel rule now primary-verified:** the `median + 16σ` figure (flagged pass 1 as
  search-snippet) is hardcoded in `DarkFrame.cpp:1738–1745`. The DSS *theory.htm* page still
  refused a direct fetch, but the equation and hot-pixel rule are confirmed from source.
- **Still web-only (no primary PDF):** the Astropy guide's exact noise-equation derivation and
  the PixInsight ADU-target / SuperBias-layer numbers come from rendered web pages and search
  snippets, not a fetchable PDF; the *direction* of each claim is corroborated by ≥2 sources
  and (for the algorithms) by source code, but a verbatim primary PDF was unavailable.
