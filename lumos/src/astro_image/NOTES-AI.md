# astro_image Module

## Module Overview

Core data structure (`AstroImage`) for astronomical image processing. Planar f32 pixel
storage, FITS/RAW/standard image I/O, CFA handling, calibration operations.

**Files:**
- `mod.rs` -- AstroImage, PixelData, ImageDimensions, BitPix, conversions, arithmetic ops
- `error.rs` -- `ImageLoadError` enum (Fits/Image/Raw/Io/UnsupportedFormat) via thiserror
- `fits.rs` -- FITS loading via cfitsio/fitsio-rs, normalization, CFA header parsing, RA/DEC parsing
- `sensor.rs` -- libraw sensor type detection from filters/colors fields
- `cfa.rs` -- CfaImage for raw CFA data, calibration ops (dark/flat), demosaic dispatch

**Architecture:**
- `PixelData`: Enum `L(Buffer2<f32>)` | `Rgb([Buffer2<f32>; 3])` -- planar storage
- `AstroImage`: PixelData + ImageDimensions + AstroImageMetadata
- `CfaImage`: Single-channel raw sensor data with CFA pattern metadata
- `ImageDimensions`: width/height/channels (only 1 or 3)
- `BitPix`: UInt8/Int16/UInt16/Int32/UInt32/Int64/Float32/Float64
- All pixel data stored as f32 normalized to [0,1]
- `ImageLoadError`: Typed error enum for all image loading paths.
  Variants: `Fits { path, source }`, `Image { path, source }`, `Raw { path, reason }`,
  `Io { path, source }`, `UnsupportedFormat { extension }`. Every variant carries the file path.
- `from_file()` returns `Result<Self, ImageLoadError>`
- `save()` returns `Result<(), imaginarium::Error>` -- PNG/JPEG/TIFF only, no FITS

**FITS metadata currently read:**
OBJECT, INSTRUME, TELESCOP, DATE-OBS, EXPTIME, ISOSPEED, FILTER, GAIN, EGAIN,
CCD-TEMP (fallback CCDTEMP), IMAGETYP (fallback FRAME), XBINNING, YBINNING,
SET-TEMP, OFFSET, FOCALLEN, AIRMASS, RA/OBJCTRA/CRVAL1, DEC/OBJCTDEC/CRVAL2,
XPIXSZ, YPIXSZ, DATAMAX, BAYERPAT, ROWORDER, XBAYROFF, YBAYROFF.

**Consumers:** star_detection, registration, stacking, calibration_masters, drizzle modules.

## Industry Standard Comparison

### FITS Standard 4.0 Compliance

**BZERO/BSCALE -- Correct.** cfitsio automatically applies BZERO/BSCALE when reading.
The `image_type_to_bitpix()` correctly maps cfitsio's `ImageType` enum (which includes
`UnsignedShort`, `UnsignedLong`, etc.) to `BitPix` variants, preserving the unsigned/signed
distinction for correct normalization. The FITS standard discourages using BSCALE/BZERO
with floating-point data (BITPIX < 0) due to overflow risk; cfitsio would still apply them
if present, but this is extremely rare in practice.

**3D FITS Data Order -- Correct.** FITS stores 3D image data in planar order (NAXIS3 planes
of NAXIS1 x NAXIS2 pixels). fitsio-rs reports shape in C order: [channels, height, width].
The loader correctly uses `from_planar_channels()` for 3-channel data.

**Integer Unsigned Convention -- Correct.** FITS only supports signed integers natively.
BITPIX=16 + BZERO=32768 + BSCALE=1 is the standard for unsigned 16-bit (by far the most
common astronomical camera output). cfitsio handles this transparently.

**HDU Structure -- Partial.** Only the primary HDU is read. The FITS standard supports
Image Extensions, ASCII Table Extensions, and Binary Table Extensions. Professional tools
(astropy, Siril, PixInsight) read all HDU types.

**BLANK Keyword -- Not handled.** The FITS standard defines the BLANK keyword for integer
images to indicate undefined/missing pixels. cfitsio can convert BLANK-valued pixels to NaN
when reading as floats. Our loader does not explicitly handle this, but cfitsio may handle
it transparently depending on read mode. For float images, NaN is the standard null indicator
and our loader already sanitizes NaN to 0.0.

### Normalization Comparison

| Tool | Integer types | Float types |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Astropy** | BZERO+BSCALE to float (no [0,1]) | Raw values preserved |
| **PixInsight** | BZERO/BSCALE then /max to [0,1] | Assumes [0,1] default (configurable) |
| **Siril** | BZERO/BSCALE to USHORT or FLOAT[0,1] | If max > 1, divide by 65535 |
| **DeepSkyStacker** | Standard | Writes float in [0,65535]; reads DATAMIN/DATAMAX |
| **APP** | Standard | Similar to PixInsight, assumes [0,1] |
| **Our impl** | /type_max to [0,1] | Heuristic: if max > 2.0, divide by max |

Our float heuristic (divide by max when max > 2.0) is a reasonable middle ground. It handles
DeepSkyStacker [0,65535] output and arbitrary-range scientific data. The 2.0 threshold provides
headroom for HDR/overexposed pixels while catching integer-like ranges. This is slightly
better than Siril's fixed /65535 approach because it adapts to any range.

**Gap vs Siril:** Siril always divides by 65535 for non-[0,1] float data, which breaks if
the data is in a different range (e.g., [0,255] or [0,100000]). Siril has been noted by users
as producing stacks with max values above 1.0 (e.g., 2.8 for star cores), so even Siril's own
output can violate the [0,1] assumption. Our max-based approach handles all ranges correctly.

**Gap vs Astropy:** Astropy does not normalize at all -- it preserves physical units. This
is correct for scientific analysis but wrong for astrophotography processing pipelines
that assume [0,1]. Our approach is correct for our use case.

**Gap vs PixInsight:** PixInsight mandates that float images specify black/white points
unambiguously (XISF spec requires this). For FITS, PixInsight uses configurable range with
[0,1] default. Our auto-detection is simpler and handles the common cases well.

**Gap vs DeepSkyStacker:** DSS reads DATAMIN/DATAMAX keywords for float normalization when
available, and scans pixel data as fallback. Our impl reads DATAMAX into metadata but does
not yet use it for normalization (see Issue 1).

### CFA/Bayer Handling

**BAYERPAT Convention -- Correct and thorough.**
BAYERPAT/XBAYROFF/YBAYROFF originated from the SBIG SBFITSEXT specification (2003). Not
part of the official FITS standard but universally used by amateur astronomy cameras and
capture software (NINA, MaximDL, CCDSoft, SGP, SharpCap).

Our handling:
- Supports RGGB, BGGR, GRBG, GBRG, TRUE (=RGGB)
- Adjusts for ROWORDER (BOTTOM-UP flips pattern vertically)
- Handles XBAYROFF/YBAYROFF integer offsets
- Matches NINA, MaximDL, Siril, PixInsight behavior

**CFA Calibration -- Correct.**
Per-CFA-channel flat normalization prevents color shift from non-white flat light sources.
This matches how PixInsight and Siril handle flat correction for Bayer/X-Trans data.
The formula `light /= (flat - bias) / mean_color(flat - bias)` is industry-standard.

**Sensor Detection -- Correct.**
`detect_sensor_type()` correctly interprets libraw's `filters` and `colors` fields:
filters=0 or colors=1 for Mono, filters=9 for X-Trans, standard bit patterns for Bayer.

### RA/DEC Coordinate Handling

**Correct and comprehensive.** Three fallback chains for each coordinate:
- RA: `RA` (degrees, NINA/SGP) -> `OBJCTRA` (HMS string, MaximDL/ASCOM) -> `CRVAL1` (WCS)
- DEC: `DEC` (degrees) -> `OBJCTDEC` (DMS string) -> `CRVAL2` (WCS)

HMS/DMS parsers handle both space-delimited ("05 35 17.3") and colon-delimited ("05:35:17.3")
formats. Negative zero-degree DEC ("-00 30 00.0" = -0.5 deg) handled correctly via sign
extraction. Full test coverage with astronomical reference values.

**Note on CRVAL1/CRVAL2 fallback:** These are WCS reference point coordinates, not necessarily
the telescope pointing direction. For plate-solved images they are accurate, but the distinction
matters if both RA/DEC and CRVAL1/CRVAL2 are present. Current priority order is correct
(prefer direct RA/DEC over WCS).

### Comparison with Specific Tools

**vs cfitsio:**
- cfitsio provides C-level FITS I/O with full standard compliance
- We use it correctly through fitsio-rs wrapper
- cfitsio handles compressed FITS transparently (Rice, GZIP, HCompress, PLIO)
- We benefit from this for reading but cannot write compressed FITS
- cfitsio manages required structural keywords (SIMPLE, BITPIX, NAXISn, END) automatically

**vs Astropy (Python):**
- Astropy preserves physical units, does not normalize to [0,1]
- Astropy supports full WCS, tables, multi-HDU, CHECKSUM/DATASUM
- Astropy handles BSCALE/BZERO with automatic header updates on save
- Astropy is a general-purpose tool; our loader is specialized for astrophotography

**vs Siril:**
- Siril uses USHORT (16-bit) or FLOAT [0,1] internally
- Siril converts 8-bit to 16-bit, 32-bit int to float, 64-bit float to 32-bit
- Siril divides non-[0,1] float by 65535 (less flexible than our max-based heuristic)
- Siril reads ROWORDER for Bayer pattern only (matches our behavior)
- Siril reads CALSTAT, more weather/environment keywords
- Siril normalizes per-channel for registration (we do this for flat correction)

**vs PixInsight:**
- PixInsight uses planar [0,1] float internally (matches our architecture)
- PixInsight reads/writes FITS with configurable float range
- PixInsight supports XISF (its native format) with mandatory black/white point spec
- PixInsight reads full WCS, all metadata keywords
- XISF supports two storage models: planar and normal (interleaved)

**vs NINA (capture software):**
- NINA writes comprehensive metadata: camera, telescope, weather, location, rotator, focuser
- Our loader reads the most important NINA keywords (see metadata list above)
- Missing NINA keywords: FOCRATIO, SITELAT/SITELONG/SITEELEV, READOUTM, rotator/focuser,
  weather (AMBTEMP, HUMIDITY, PRESSURE, DEWPOINT, MPSAS, SKYTEMP, WINDSPD, etc.)

## Missing Features (with Severity)

### Critical -- None

The module correctly handles the core use case: loading FITS images from astronomical
cameras, normalizing to [0,1], and providing calibration operations.

### High

**H1: No FITS Writing Support.**
`save()` only supports PNG/JPEG/TIFF via imaginarium. FITS is the primary interchange
format for astrophotography. Stacking results, calibrated masters, and processed images
should be saveable as FITS with metadata preserved. Every other tool in this space (Siril,
PixInsight, DSS, ASTAP) writes FITS output.

fitsio-rs supports writing via:
- `FitsFile::create(path).with_custom_primary(&desc).open()` -- create file with image HDU
- `hdu.write_image(&mut fptr, &data)` -- write pixel data
- `hdu.write_key(&mut fptr, "KEY", value)` -- write header keywords
- `ImageDescription { data_type: ImageType::Float, dimensions: &[height, width] }`

Implementation should write BITPIX=-32 (float32) in [0,1] range (PixInsight convention).
Must write back all `AstroImageMetadata` fields as FITS keywords. For RGB, write as 3D
with dimensions [3, height, width] (NAXIS3=3).

### Medium

**M2: Missing FOCRATIO (Focal Ratio).** -- POSTPONED
Written by NINA. Useful for optical calculations and metadata display.

**M3: No Multi-HDU Support.** -- POSTPONED
Only the primary HDU is read. Compressed FITS stores the image in an extension HDU.
Some observatories use multi-extension FITS. cfitsio can read named/numbered HDUs but
the loader does not attempt this. When the primary HDU has NAXIS=0, should try reading
the first image extension.

**M4: Missing CALSTAT (Calibration Status).** -- POSTPONED
Tracks which calibration frames have been applied (B=bias, D=dark, F=flat). Prevents
accidental double-calibration. Written by Siril and some other tools.

**M5: Missing SITELAT/SITELONG/SITEELEV (Observatory Location).** -- POSTPONED
Written by NINA. Needed for atmospheric refraction correction and precise timing.

**M6: DATAMAX Not Used for Float Normalization.** -- POSTPONED
DATAMAX is read into `data_max` field but not used by `normalize_fits_pixels()`.
DeepSkyStacker uses DATAMIN/DATAMAX for float range detection when present. Using
DATAMAX would be more reliable than scanning all pixels. See Issue 1.

### Low -- POSTPONED

**L1: Missing READOUTM (Readout Mode).**
Camera readout mode (e.g., "Normal", "Low Noise"). Written by NINA.

**L2: Missing DARKTIME.**
Dark current integration time. May differ from EXPTIME for cameras with mechanical
shutters. Used for dark frame scaling.

**L3: Missing PEDESTAL.**
ADU offset added during calibration. Some cameras/software add a pedestal to prevent
negative values.

**L4: No FITS CHECKSUM/DATASUM Support.**
Data integrity verification defined in the FITS Checksum Convention. Detects file
corruption. Supported by cfitsio, astropy, and professional observatories.

**L5: Missing Weather/Environment Keywords.**
NINA writes AMBTEMP, HUMIDITY, PRESSURE, DEWPOINT, MPSAS, SKYTEMP, WINDSPD, etc.
Useful for data quality filtering but not critical for image processing.

**L6: Missing SWCREATE/OBSERVER.**
Software creator and observer name. Metadata only; no processing impact.

**L7: No WCS Keywords Beyond CRVAL1/CRVAL2.**
Full WCS requires CRPIX1/2, CDELT1/2, CROTA2 (old style) or CD1_1/CD1_2/CD2_1/CD2_2
(rotation matrix) or PC-matrix. CTYPE1/2 for projection type (e.g., 'RA---TAN',
'DEC--TAN'). Needed for pixel-to-sky coordinate transformation. SIP convention adds
polynomial distortion terms. Not needed unless implementing plate solving or astrometric
calibration.

## Correctness Issues

### Issue 1: Float Normalization Heuristic Could Misfire on Unusual Data

**Severity: Low (heuristic is reasonable for target use case)**

The heuristic normalizes float FITS data by dividing by max when max > 2.0. Edge cases:

1. **Physical unit FITS** (e.g., flux in Jy) with max = 1.5: correctly left alone, but
   downstream processing assumes [0,1] and would produce wrong results.
2. **All-negative data** (e.g., fully dark-subtracted): max could be < 2.0 with values
   like [-0.5, 1.8], left unnormalized. This is actually correct behavior.
3. **Single bright pixel at 3.0** with rest in [0,1]: would divide everything by 3.0,
   potentially squashing valid HDR data.

**Improvement:** Use DATAMAX keyword first (already read into `data_max` field). If present
and > 2.0, use it as the normalization divisor instead of computing max from pixel data.
This is what DeepSkyStacker does. Fall back to max-based heuristic only when keywords
are absent.

### Issue 2: Int16 Normalization Asymmetry (Minor)

**Severity: Negligible**

Int16 normalization divides by 32767. This maps -32768 to -1.000031 (slightly beyond -1.0).
The asymmetry is 1 part in 32768, which is negligible for astronomical processing. The Int16
path is also very rare -- nearly all astronomical cameras use the BZERO=32768 unsigned
convention, which maps to UInt16.

### Issue 3: NaN/Inf Handling in FITS Data -- FIXED

`normalize_fits_pixels()` sanitizes NaN/Inf to 0.0 for float BitPix types before
normalization. Integer types are not sanitized (cfitsio should never produce NaN for
integer data). This ensures the invariant that source images are NaN-free after loading.

### Issue 4: ROWORDER Handling is Correct

**Not a bug.** ROWORDER is used only for Bayer pattern adjustment, not for pixel flipping.
This matches Siril's behavior and is the pragmatic choice. Most capture software writes
TOP-DOWN (MaximDL always writes TOP-DOWN). NINA also writes ROWORDER=TOP-DOWN.

### Issue 5: Metadata Lost on Standard Image Formats

**Severity: Low (acceptable for current use case)**

When loading PNG/JPEG/TIFF via imaginarium, `AstroImageMetadata` gets `Default::default()`.
No EXIF extraction is attempted. This is fine because these formats are rarely used as
primary astro formats -- they are typically output formats. TIFF can carry metadata but
astro software uses FITS for that purpose.

---

## Unnecessary Complexity

### None Found

The module is well-structured with clear separation of concerns:

- `PixelData` enum is the right abstraction for planar L/RGB data
- `BitPix` enum correctly models the FITS type system including unsigned variants
- `CfaType` enum properly handles Mono/Bayer/X-Trans
- The flat normalization has the right mono/CFA branching
- Test coverage is thorough with hand-computed expected values

The `From<Image>` implementation has some code duplication between packed and strided paths,
but this is justified by the performance difference (avoiding unnecessary per-pixel stride
calculations for packed data).

The `to_image()` and `Into<Image>` implementations are functionally identical. `to_image()`
borrows while `Into<Image>` consumes. Having both is reasonable for different use cases.

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Add FITS Writing

Implement `save_fits()` using fitsio-rs write functions. Should:
1. Create file with `FitsFile::create(path).with_custom_primary(&desc).open()`
2. Write pixel data with `hdu.write_image(&mut fptr, &data)`
3. Write all `AstroImageMetadata` fields back as FITS keywords with `hdu.write_key()`
4. Write as BITPIX=-32 (float32) normalized [0,1] to match PixInsight convention
5. For RGB: NAXIS=3, NAXIS3=3, planar layout (write R plane, then G, then B)
6. For grayscale: NAXIS=2
7. Write SWCREATE="Scenarium" for provenance tracking
8. Consider optional BITPIX=16 with BZERO=32768 for tools that prefer integer FITS

### Priority 2: Use DATAMAX for Float Normalization -- POSTPONED

When loading float FITS, check `data_max` after reading keywords. If present and > 2.0,
use it as normalization divisor instead of scanning pixels. This matches DeepSkyStacker
behavior and is more reliable for files that include this keyword.
(Note: DATAMAX is already read into `data_max` field but not yet used for normalization.)

### Priority 3: Multi-HDU Support (When Needed) -- POSTPONED

When encountering an empty primary HDU (NAXIS=0), try reading the first image extension.
This handles compressed FITS (which store data in BINTABLE extensions) and some observatory
multi-extension formats.

---

## Memory Layout

**Planar storage** (`PixelData::Rgb([Buffer2<f32>; 3])`):
- Each channel is a contiguous `Vec<f32>` of width*height elements
- Row-major order within each channel
- Matches PixInsight XISF internal format
- Optimal for per-channel operations (statistics, convolution, stacking)
- Suboptimal for per-pixel RGB operations (cache misses across 3 buffers)

**Trade-off:** Planar is the right choice for astro processing. Per-channel operations
dominate the processing pipeline (stacking, calibration, statistics, detection).

---

## Test Coverage

**fits.rs tests:**
- Float normalization: 10 tests covering [0,1] passthrough, HDR headroom, threshold
  boundary, [0,65535] range, [0,255] range, negative values, all-zero, single pixel
- NaN/Inf sanitization: 6 tests for NaN/Inf replacement, NaN with normalization,
  all-NaN, Float64 NaN, integer NaN passthrough
- RA/DEC parsing: 9 tests for HMS/DMS with space/colon delimiters, zero values,
  negative zero degrees, invalid inputs

**cfa.rs tests:**
- CfaType: 5 tests for Mono/Bayer/XTrans color_at and wrapping
- Calibration: 10 tests for subtract, flat division (mono/Bayer), vignetting,
  bias subtraction, non-white flat color shift correction

- 23 tests: metadata, Image conversions, FITS loading, save/load roundtrip,
  RGBA/LA alpha dropping, pixel access, grayscale conversion, interleaving,
  SubAssign, ImageDimensions validation, BitPix roundtrip

**sensor.rs tests:**
- 7 tests for filter pattern detection (RGGB/BGGR/GRBG/GBRG/unknown) and
  sensor type detection (mono/bayer/xtrans/unknown)
