Do a thorough research of each module in this crate. For each module:

1. Look for industry standards and best practices online
2. Compare with the current implementation
3. Create or update a relevant NOTES-AI.md file with your findings

Focus on:
- What we don't do but should (missing industry-standard features)
- What we do incorrectly (bugs, wrong algorithms, wrong formulas)
- What we do that's not needed (unnecessary complexity)
- Improvements and simplifications
- Consistency issues across modules
- Incorrect implementations vs reference papers/tools

Take your time. Research each module in parallel. After all modules are done, write a cross-cutting summary at the crate root level.
